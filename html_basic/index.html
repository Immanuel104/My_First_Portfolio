    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome Webpage</h1>

    <p>This is my first attempt at making a cool webpage. It's simple but effective.</p>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am learning web development, and this is my first HTML project. I am enjoying the process so far!</p>

    <h3>What I Plan to Learn</h3>
    <p>By the end of this course, I aim to master HTML, CSS, and maybe even JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>Did you know? The first website ever was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It was just a basic page explaining the World Wide Web project.</p>
